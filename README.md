# affine_gf2

## Goal
Affine_gf2 is a useful tool for e.g. solving crypto capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges. Sometimes these challenges require you to solve a set of linear equations, decompose a binary vector as a linear combination of a given set of binary vectors, or find a fixed point of an affine transformation. This requires only simple linear algebra, and a package as SageMath cas easily do this. Affine_gf2 provides an easy interface to these functionalities, without having to worryt about how to construct the matrices, whether you are dealing with left- or right-multiplicayion and such.
